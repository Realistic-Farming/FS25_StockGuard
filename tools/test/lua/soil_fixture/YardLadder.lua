-- FS25 Soil & Fertilizer - THE YARD LADDER (SF-46)
-- =========================================================
-- An unwrapped bale left out goes off. Condition, never a fill
-- bleed: this member holds a per-bale CONDITION record in the
-- delivered object ledger, accrues it on a shelter ladder once
-- per day, pauses it under wrap, reads it as bands into the feed
-- chain, and ends it in ONE server-authoritative condemnation
-- event.
--
-- The condemnation write (fillLevel 0 then delete) is the ONLY
-- write this member makes to a bale's fill state.
--
-- SERVER ONLY. Rows ride MaterialDown's object-ledger mechanism
-- (StateLedger table, OPAQUE OWNER TOKEN, enumerate-not-list).
--
-- TWO THINGS THE BRIEF ASSUMED AND THE ENGINE DOES NOT PROVIDE,
-- both honoured in their honest half rather than faked:
--
--   1. THE ENCLOSED TIER. The ruled ladder has three rungs
--      (outdoors 1.0, roof 0.15x, enclosed 0). The engine's
--      shelter predicate is BINARY: indoorMask has INDOOR and
--      OUTDOOR and nothing between (verified against the LUADOC;
--      no three-state predicate exists anywhere in the reference).
--      So v1 ships TWO rungs and an unverifiable enclosure is
--      charged the ROOF rate, never zero. That is the same
--      direction the sibling's rule takes when shelter cannot be
--      proven: unverifiable cover does not earn the benefit. A
--      free rung would stop a yard's condition dead on evidence
--      the engine never gave us.
--
--   2. THE BIRTH AXIS. The birth read returns a WETNESS PERCENT.
--      The ladder accrues CONDITION UNITS. The brief never states
--      the mapping between them, and they cannot be the same
--      number: the ruled horizons (going-off about a wet week at
--      40 units, condemned about 2.5 wet weeks at 100) only hold
--      if condition starts at zero, whereas the seasonal stub
--      would open a winter bale at 75, already past going-off and
--      four wet days from condemnation. So birth wetness is
--      RECORDED and PUBLISHED as its own quantity and does not
--      seed the ladder. Picking the curve that joins them is a
--      design call, not an implementation one; it is on the
--      ledger for Arissani.

-- THE BIRTH AXIS, RULED BY ARISSANI 2026-07-30. This is the mapping the first cut
-- guessed at and this member refused to invent.
--
-- A bale made from FIT material is born at ZERO. The penalty is for how far ABOVE the
-- safe-baling line the material was WHEN IT WAS BALED, which is the actual mistake a
-- real farmer makes and the entire reason a fit line exists.
--
--   condition = max(0, wetnessPct - FIT_PCT) x PER_POINT_ABOVE_FIT
--
-- ONE POINT ABOVE THE LINE COSTS ONE WET-DAY EQUIVALENT, so the handicap is expressed
-- in terms of the wet rate rather than as a second free-standing number: if the ladder
-- is ever retuned the handicap follows it, which is what "wet-day equivalent" means.
--
-- Walking it against the ruled ladder, which is how the dial was set:
--   baled at 20 -> 0    a full wet week to going off
--   baled at 25 -> 30   going off inside two wet days
--   baled at 27 -> 42   born already going off
--   baled at 30 -> 60   condemned inside a week
--
-- Deliberately unforgiving: hay baled at 27 percent moulds within a week in a real
-- yard, and a gentler curve would say baling wet costs almost nothing, which is false.
-- Flagged as a DIAL rather than a derivation. If it plays too harsh it is one number.
--
-- The fit line itself is agronomy-fixed rather than taste: the published safe-baling
-- line is 18 to 20 and 20 is the generous edge of safe. Read from the hay member so
-- there is one fit line in the mod, not two.

-- A row is one bale's condition record in MaterialDown's object ledger, schema 2:
--
--   { schema = 2, token, nativeBaleUniqueId, nativeFillType, observedLitres, farmId,
--     carrierState, rowRevision, nextCarrierEventSequence, portions,
--     capacity, bornDay, fillTypeName }            -- the last three: compatibility only
--
-- and every portion (one per bale in this build; a pack of several is the held wider
-- work) carries
--
--   { historyId, sourceStreamId, nextEventSequence, portionRevision, litres, profileId,
--     profileVersion, historyKnowledge, condition, birthWetnessKnown, birthWetnessPct,
--     observedFromDay, lastSettledDay, conditionGeneration }
--
-- BINDING IS THE NATIVE UNIQUE ID, never a similarity. A bale has its persistent id when
-- it registers (Bale:loadFromConfigXML sets a loaded one, Bale.lua:269-270, and the item
-- system assigns one otherwise, ItemSystem.lua:209-213); it keeps it through object
-- storage (PlaceableObjectStorage.lua:947, :965, :1161) and a savegame. The old
-- farm + fill type + capacity match is gone: a row nothing can prove is UNBOUND and
-- stays unknown.
--
-- CARRIER STATES. WORLD: the bale is registered in the world. STORED: it is in an object
-- storage (its native object may not exist). PENDING: loaded from a save, waiting for its
-- bale to register. UNBOUND: no native id can be proved (a legacy row, or a row from a
-- store the career did not vouch for).
--
-- EVENTS. BIRTH (a new row), ADVANCE (the daily condition increase), REBIND (into or out
-- of storage), RETIRE (the bale left, condemnation included). RESET belongs to a proved
-- unwrap, a physical policy that is held; nothing emits it in this build. Each event:
-- every listener's beforeChange, the change once, the row and portion coordinates
-- committed, then every listener's afterChange (or invalidate, when its before failed or
-- its after throws). A listener error never blocks the change. [SG-3 Part 3] BIRTH, REBIND
-- and RETIRE carry the StockGuard operation open around them (_openOperationId); ADVANCE
-- never does (it is SG-3's route 2, a change with no joined operation).

-- exact bale createBale appended, through its creation frame. Its birth reaches

-- condition gives no confident wetness (no known-only mean becomes a whole-bale
-- claim), so that bale opens at zero condition, per the ruling, and its history is
-- UNKNOWN. Every other door (unpacking, console, a purchase) is born unknown: the ground
-- under a bale is never read as its collected history.

--- Today, for stamping a birth. The accrual's ctx.monotonicDay is the authority on
